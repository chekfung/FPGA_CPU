# FPGA_CPU
A 32 bit CPU written in Verilog utilizing ARM Assembly machine instructions and deployed on a Xilinx Spartan-3A chipset. 

At the moment, this implementation is a **WORK IN PROGRESS** and is not anywhere close to being done. As this is a personal project that I am doing on my own time, we will see when we will see an implementation that actually works.

This project is loosely based on a similar project in Digital Computing Systems (ENGN0500), taught by Professor Rosenstein which implemented a 32-bit CPU on Logism, a GUI based digital logic Editor that simulated design.
